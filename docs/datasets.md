# Datasets
SLICE has curated a list of available open-source datasets for ML EDA applications. 

## Digital circuit design
* [DATC RDF calibrations repository](https://github.com/ieee-ceda-datc/datc-rdf-calibrations)
    - Calibrations data for timing analysis, parasitic estimation, and static IR drop
* [BeGAN benchmarks](https://github.com/UMN-EDA/BeGAN-benchmarks)
    - Power delivery network benchmarks generated by GANs
* [ML-for-IR-drop](https://github.com/ASU-VDA-Lab/ML-for-IR-drop)
    - ICCAD 2023 Contest Benchmarks for ProblemC IR drop analysis
* [OpenROAD public CI test suite](https://jenkins.openroad.tools/blue/organizations/jenkins/OpenROAD-flow-scripts-Public%2Fpublic_tests_all/activity)
    - OpenROAD-flow-scripts and public regressions for several designs
* [CircuitNet](https://github.com/circuitnet/CircuitNet)
    - Datasets for congestion, DRC, IR drop, and net delay estimation
* [Artificial netlist generator](https://github.com/daeyeon22/artificial_netlist_generator)
    - Gate-level technology-independent netlist generator
* [Verilog dataset for LLMs](https://github.com/shailja-thakur/VGen)

## Analog circuit design
