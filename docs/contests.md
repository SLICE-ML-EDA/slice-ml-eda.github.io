# ML EDA Contests
SLICE has curated a list of contests that have encouraged the use of machine learning techniques in EDA

* [MLCAD 2023 FPGA Macro Placement](https://mlcad-workshop.org/1st-mlcad-contest-2023/)
    - Towards academic research for developing ML or deep RL approaches to improve upon the current state-of-the-art macro placement tools.
    - 

* [ICCAD 2023 Problem C ML for IR Drop](https://github.com/ASU-VDA-Lab/ML-for-IR-drop/blob/main/doc/contest-description.pdf)
    - Advacning ML-based IR drop prediction and providing a standard set of benchmarks for training and evaluation. 

* [ISPD 2024 GPU/ML-enhanced Large Scale Global Routing](https://liangrj2014.github.io/ISPD24_contest/)
    - Goal is to stimulate academic research aimed at developing a GPU/ML-enhanced global router tailored for industrial-level circuits 

* [ICCAD 2024 Logic Gate Sizing Using ML](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12fvhDTtsN74X2qDZYsIvyCret5JHENzk/view)
