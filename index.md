# SLICE-ML-EDA

## A Shared Machine Learning Infrastructure for the Community of EDA

The SLICE project aims to overcome the barriers to applying machine learning (ML) techniques to electronic design automation (EDA) and chip design problems by building a shareable and extensible infrastructure containing unified design environments, software interfaces between EDA tools and ML platforms, labeled datasets, and pre-trained ML models. Motivated by the spectacular success of the flywheel effect of infrastructure in the broader AI, SLICE aims to create a similar effect for the ML EDA flywheel (shown in Fig. 1) by establishing an open infrastructure.

The infrastructure takes inspiration from the available infrastructure of the ML/AI community, as highlighted in Fig. 2. The SLICE infrastructure consists of EDA tools, datasets, PDKs, tutorials, contests, and educational material.
