# SLICE

## A Shared Machine Learning Infrastructure for the EDA Community

The SLICE project aims to overcome the barriers to applying machine learning (ML) techniques to electronic design automation (EDA) and chip design problems by building a shareable and extensible infrastructure containing unified design environments, software interfaces between EDA tools and ML platforms, labeled datasets, and pre-trained ML models. Motivated by the spectacular success of the flywheel effect of infrastructure in the broader AI, SLICE aims to create a similar effect for the ML EDA flywheel (shown in figure) by establishing an open infrastructure.

The infrastructure takes inspiration from the available infrastructure of the ML/AI community. The broader AI community, which is free of these bottlenecks, has a tradition of open and shared infrastructure: “papers with code”, dataset repositories such as Kaggle and OpenML, model libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and pretrained model repositories such as Hugging Face. As shown in figure, the proposed SLICE  project aims to remove the barriers and build an analogous infrastructure for the ML EDA community that will help advance research rapidly.
